  description: This project focuses on the effects and underlying mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal interventions on traumatic memories in college students. Based on memory reconsolidation mechanisms, the research aims to modify the emotional impact of traumatic memories and improve mental health outcomes. Various psychological experimental techniques and brain imaging methods will be used to assess these interventions' effectiveness and neural basis. This project is supported by the Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Youth Fund and the Shenzhen Basic Research Natural Science Foundation.

- title: "Aversive Reversal & Neurocomputational Mechanisms"
  subtitle: "Project on abnormal aversive reversal and its neurocomputational mechanisms in patients with anxiety disorders"

  description: This project investigates the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying abnormal fear reversal in patients with anxiety disorders. The research aims to identify specific neural pathways and biomarkers associated with fear reversal deficits using advanced neuroimaging techniques, neuromodulation, and psychological experimental methods with computational modeling (e.g., reinforcement learning). Findings from this study may contribute to the development of more accurate diagnoses and treatments for anxiety disorders. This project is funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China.

- title: "Reward Learning & Neurocomputational Mechanisms"
  subtitle: "Project on neurocomputational mechanisms and interventions for reward learning deficits in patients with depressive disorders"
  image: "images/project2.png"
  description: This project investigates the neural computational mechanisms underlying reward learning deficits in patients with depressive disorders. Using a combination of neuroimaging, computational modeling, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, the study aims to elucidate how reward processing is disrupted in depression and to develop effective interventions to address these deficits. This project is funded by the Shenzhen Basic Research Natural Science Foundation.

- title: "COVID-19 related Mental Health"
  subtitle: "Project on psychological mechanisms and interventions for the mental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different sociodemographics including gender, sexuality, age, work conditions, and others."

  description: This project investigates the roles of resilience and social support in mediating the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and both negative (depression, anxiety) and positive (post-traumatic growth) mental health outcomes among Chinese individuals, aiming to explore the psychological mechanisms behind these diverse mental health responses to the pandemic.

- title: "Sexual Minority Chinese Young Men & Suicidal Ideation"
  subtitle: "Project on psychological mechanisms and psychosocial interventions for the mental effects of sexual minority groups."
  image: "images/projectsm.jpg"
  group: featured
  link: https://osf.io/2udmz/
  description: This project investigates the mediating role of psychosocial factors—such as parental and social support, and self-perceptions in self-esteem or masculinity—between sexual orientation and suicidal ideation among Chinese sexual minority and heterosexual young men, aiming to identify potential intervention targets to reduce suicide risk among sexual minority males.
