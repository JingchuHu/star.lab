Congratulations to Yiting Huang for publishing on Frontier in Psychiatry as the first author of the article 'Understanding suicidal ideation disparity between sexual minority and heterosexual Chinese young men: a multiple mediation model of social support sources, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms'.

The Frontiers in Psychiatry is an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on translational and ‘bench-to-beside’ approaches to improve therapeutic options for mental illness and consequently to improve patient treatment outcomes.

In the article, we examined and found the multiple mediating effects of psychosocial factors between sexual orientation and suicidal ideation in Chinese sexual minority and heterosexual young men.
