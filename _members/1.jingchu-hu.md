Jingchu Hu is a research associate and psychotherapist at the Shenzhen Mental Health Center (Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, The Affiliated Mental Health Center, Southern University of Science and Technology). Jingchu finished her PhD studies in clinical psychology at South China Normal University and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, quit her second PhD studies in medical science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and declined the post-doctoral research fellow offer at the Medicine School of Yale University (due to the covid-19 outbreak). Jingchu's research focusing on the pathological psychological and neurological mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and traumatic memories, with the aim of improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Using psychological experiments, brain imaging, non-invasive brain stimulation, and computational modeling, Jingchu develops novel interventions based on memory reconsolidation mechanisms for MDD and PTSD. The research also investigates neurocomputational mechanisms in anxiety and depressive disorders using a variety of psychological and decision-making tasks. The lab's projects include assessing the efficacy of reconsolidation-based cognitive reappraisal for traumatic memories in depression, investigating the neural mechanisms of this intervention, and evaluating its long-term effects and clinical application. Another project also examines public mental health, particularly for minority groups.
